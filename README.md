This is the HTML Project about Recipes.

A recipe is a set of instructions that outlines how to prepare and cook a specific dish or drink. It typically includes a list of ingredients, measurements, and step-by-step instructions for the cooking process. Recipes can vary in complexity, from simple and quick recipes for everyday meals to more elaborate and time-consuming recipes for special occasions or gourmet dishes.
The project contains multiple HTML files, each focusing on a specific aspect of web development.

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues with the project or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to participate and give your contribution.
